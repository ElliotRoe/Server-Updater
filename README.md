# server-updater
I'm currently developing my personal website and I thought it would be cool to write a python script that manages version control on my server directly.
This most likely has already been done before but I thought it would be nice to challenge myself to create a solution myself!

# How it works (Hopefully)
It continually checks this remote repository for changes and if there are any it will pull any updates and automatically place files in the correct place for my personal website. Obviously this may not be the most secure of solutions.
